# quant_trading

This is a repo to showcase my personal project which uses quantitative methods to devise trading strategies.

1) The notebooks files are for processing and visualizing the data. Some models are also tested.
2) app/scrapers: scrapers to obtain financial data.
3) app/models: models for different strategies
4) app/backtest: backtesting strategies based on historical prices
